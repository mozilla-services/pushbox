# Pushbox Prototype

This is a work in progress of the serverless PushBox supplimental sync
storage service using the [serverless](https://github.com/serverless) framework

## requirements:
* [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
    * [See configuration info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)

Please note, Severless currently does not support python "offline", you will
have to `sls deploy` in order to test. (Remember to run `sls remove` after
